# Leaderboard

## Filtering

### How to filter using the time range

- Step 1: Each leaderboard has a timeline bar at the top of the table or chart.
- Step 2: The tooltip shows the selected time range. Drag the handles to adjust the range. For example, you might select [Mar 2025, Aug 2025].

### What filters are available in the leaderboard?

- In table view, there is a timeline range bar (blue bar at the top) and a header bar for modality/dataset filters.
- Some leaderboards include checkboxes that let you filter by additional dimensions.
- In chart view, you can also switch the displayed metric by clicking the metric buttons.

### How to apply additional filters

- Step 1: In certain leaderboards (Code Generation, Code Translation, Code Reasoning, Multi‑Modality), additional filters appear between the header filters and the results.
- Step 2: By default, no additional filters are applied (equivalent to selecting all options).
- Step 3: Use the checkboxes to narrow the results. For example, filter by dataset "HackerRank" and knowledge "Data Structures".

## Chart View

### What is in the chart view

- The chart view shows model performance for a selected metric over the model release date.
- It includes the header filter bar (modality/dataset), any additional dimension filters, and the timeline range bar.
- Below the graph, the model results for the selected metric are listed.

### How to see extra information in the graph

- Step 1: Hover over a data point to see the model name, release date, and exact metric value.
- Step 2: Zoom in or out using the green (zoom in) and orange (zoom out) buttons.
- Step 3 (PC only): After zooming in, you can:
Dragging: Pan the view
Ctrl+Drag: Select an area
Double‑click: Reset

## Table View

### How to adjust the table

- Step 1: Besides using filters, click a column header to sort ascending or descending (default: ascending by rank).
- Step 2: Click the Rank header to reset sorting.
- Step 3: Drag a header edge to increase or decrease the column width to focus on specific results.
- Step 4: Hover a header to see the full metric name.
- Step 5: Click a model name in the Model column to open that model’s detail page.
- Step 6: Use the horizontal scrollbar under the table to view columns that are off‑screen.

## Compare

### How to open the compare section

- Click the "Compare" button under the title.

### What is in the compare section

- The compare section visualizes the table results using bar or radar charts for a clearer, side‑by‑side comparison between models.

### How to compare models

- Step 1: In the Select Models area, choose up to 5 models to compare.
- Step 2: The Performance Comparison chart updates to show the selected models.
- Step 3: Click a model name in the legend to temporarily hide or show it in the chart.
- Step 4: Hover to see detailed metric values.
- Notice: If filters are enabled, the compare section reflects them (e.g., it shows "Modality: Python" for the Python leaderboard).

## Exporting

### How to export the results

- Click the green "Export" button under the title.
- In table view, a CSV file with the numerical data is exported.
- In chart view, the chart image is exported.
